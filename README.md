# Mobile Flashcards

This app was created as the 3rd project for the React Udacity Nanodegree. It allows a user to create flashcard decks and quiz themselves. The app will send a notification if the user has not completed a quiz that day.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). I developed and tested this project using iOS.

## Installation & Setup
